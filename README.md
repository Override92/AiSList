# AiSList
Community-maintained lists of YouTube channels that primarily use AI-generated content. These lists are used by the [AI Channel Blocker for Youtube](https://github.com/Override92/AiBlock) browser extension to help you filter AI-generated content on YouTube.

## How to Contribute
I welcome contributions from the community! Please help, identifying AI-generated content channels on YouTube.

### Before You Submit

**What qualifies as an AI channel?**

A YouTube channel should be added if it:
- Uses AI-generated voices (text-to-speech, synthetic narration) as primary content
- Uses AI-generated visuals (Midjourney, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion) without disclosure
- Heavily relies on automation with minimal human creativity
- Mass-produces content using AI tools

**What does NOT qualify?**

- Channels that occasionally use AI tools as part of creative work
- Channels that review or discuss AI technology
- Channels with light AI editing assistance (grammar, suggestions)
- Educational content about AI

**When in doubt:** 
- Possible case for the warnlist
